# Linear Regression  

This repository documents my studies on **Linear Regression**, one of the most fundamental methods in statistics and machine learning.  

## Contents  

1. **Introduction to Statistical Linear Regression**  
   - Concept and intuition  
   - Simple vs. multiple regression  
   - Mathematical formulation  

2. **Implementation** 
   - Step-by-step implementation from scratch
   - Application with standard libraries

3. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Coefficient of Determination (RÂ²)  
   - Residual Sum of Squares (RSS)   
   - Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)  

4. **Case Studies**  
   - Predicting continuous variables (e.g., displacement, miles per gallon (mpg), sales, etc.)  
   - Analyzing relationships between features and outcomes


## Tools and Libraries  

- **Programming Language:** R  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab
- **Libraries:** ISLR


## Objectives  

- Strengthen my understanding of regression analysis and its applications.  
- Bridge theoretical concepts with hands-on implementation.  
- Build a solid foundation for more advanced machine learning techniques (e.g., regularization, non-linear models).  


## Next Steps  

- Explore **regularization methods** (Ridge and Lasso regression).  
- Apply linear regression to **real-world datasets** for more comprehensive insights.  


## Note  

This repository was developed for **educational purposes** and reflects my ongoing learning process in Data Science.  
It is intended to document my progress and demonstrate my commitment to continuous development in the field.
